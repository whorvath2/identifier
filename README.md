# Identifier

A python project to provide identifiers as a service.

Identifier provides an API by which identifiers can be requested that are guaranteed to be 
unique within the context of the service instance's backing data store.

The longer-term goal of this project is to not only provide new unique identifiers, but to accept
entity data and supply existing identifiers based on identity-matching algorithms that offer the
client a customizable degree of certainty that those attributes have been matched to an entity 
already known to the instance.

## Setup

### Set environment variables

Create a file named `.env` in this project's root directory, and populate it with the following keys and your values:

    # zsh
    export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=identifier_api
    export COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml
    export TLS_KEY=[String; the location of the file containing the key for the web server certificate. 
                    E.g.: ./identifier.key]
    export TLS_CERT=[String; the location of the file containing the public web server certificate. 
                     E.g.: ./identifier.crt]
    export IDENTIFIER_LOG_LEVEL=[String; Logging level for the identifier app; "DEBUG", "INFO", etc.]
    export IDENTIFIER_DATA_PATH=[String; Filepath to the directory where identifier's data will be stored]
    export IDENTIFIER_MAX_READER_COUNT=[Integer; Maximum number of read-only repository instances]
    export IDENTIFIER_MAX_RETRIES=[Integer; Maximum number of times to retry a write operation]
    export IDENTIFIER_TEXT_ENCODING=[String; Encoding scheme for text data I/O; default is "utf-8"]
    export BUILD_ID=[String; Tag for the current build of Identifier; see ./setup.cfg for the version no.]

Alternatively, set the environment variables in [docker-compose](docker-compose.yml) by specifying
their values directly, though this is not a recommended practice for security and portability
reasons.

*Suggestion*: use [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) for creating and installing
certificates suitable for use in development (*not* in production.)

### Create a virtual environment for Python

    python3 -m venv .venv

### Activate the virtual environment and the identifier environment

    source .venv/bin/activate
    source .env

### Build the identifier package

    pip install setuptools
    pip install build
    pip install pytest
    python -m build

## Installation

This will install the identifier api in the python virtual environment:

    pip install dist/co.deability.identifier-[version]-py3-none-any.whl

## Running the Identifier API

### Manual startup

    cd src
    python -m co.deability.identifier.api.app

### Containerized startup

    sh build.sh

[Open your browser](https://localhost:4430/identifier) to verify that it's running, or use `curl`:

    curl https://localhost:4430/identifier

The output should look like this:

    {
        "build_id": "local"
        "status": "OK",
        "timestamp": "Fri, 11 Feb 2022 17:10:13 +0000"
        ...
    }

Note: additional information is included in pre-production environments

## Contributing

You can leverage tools during development to make life simpler.

### Environment

Create an additional environment file named `.env_dev` that specifies the following variables:

    export COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose-dev.yml
    export CERT_SUBJ=[String; Subject line for a self-signed certificate for development;
                      e.g., /C=US/ST=Michigan/L=Saline/O=Codeability/CN=*.localhost]
    export LOCAL_DATA_PATH=[String; file path on a formatted block storage device mounted in the host 
                            where identifier's data will be stored when it is run inside a container;
                            see docker-compose-dev.yml]

### Build

Using the `build_dev.sh` script will shorten your build time by obviating the downloading of dependencies that are
included in the `identifier_api` image created by `build.sh`. Note that the `build.sh` script must be run at least once
prior to running `build_dev.sh`:

    sh build.sh
    ...
    sh build_dev.sh

### Pre-Commit

Identifier uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to add hooks to git that will 
fire before a commit is accepted. Install it in your virtual environment via pip:

    pip install pre-commit

The configuration file at [.pre-commit-config.yaml](.pre-commit-config.yaml) specifies that `pytest` 
should run prior to committing local changes. Add it to your local git repository's pre-commit 
hooks script using pre-commit's installer:

    pre-commit install

### Testing

To run the available unit and integration tests manually:

    pytest src/tests
