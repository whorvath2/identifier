# Identifier

A python project to provide identifiers as a service.

Identifier provides an API by which identifiers can be requested that are guaranteed to be 
unique within the context of the service instance's backing data store.

The longer-term goal of this project is to not only provide new unique identifiers, but to accept
entity data and supply existing identifiers based on identity-matching algorithms that offer the
client a customizable degree of certainty that those attributes have been matched to an entity 
already known to the instance.

## Setup

### Create a virtual environment for Python

    python3 -m venv .venv

### Set environment variables

Create a .env file in the root directory, and populate it with the following keys and your values:

    IDENTIFIER_DATA_PATH=[String; Filepath to the directory on the host in which identifier's data will be stored]
    IDENTIFIER_LOG_LEVEL=[String; Logging level for the identifier app; "DEBUG", "INFO", etc.]
    BUILD_ID=[String; Tag for the current build of Identifier; see ./setup.cfg for the version no.]
    FLASK_ENV=[String; Flask's environment setting - development, production, etc.]
    IUID=[Integer; value for the user ID for the owner of the identifier process; e.g. 1001]
    IGID=[Integer; value for the group ID for the owner of the identifier process; e.g. 1002]
    IDENTIFIER_MAX_READER_COUNT=[Integer; Maximum number of reader repository instances]
    IDENTIFIER_MAX_RETRIES=[Integer; Maximum number of times to retry a write operation]
    CERT_SUBJ=[String; Subject line for the self-signed certificate; e.g., "/C=US/ST=Michigan/L=Saline/O=Codeability/CN=*.localhost"]

Alternatively, set the environment variables in [docker-compose](docker-compose.yml) by specifying
their values directly, though this is not a recommended practice for security and transportability
reasons.

*Suggestion*: use [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) for creating and installing
certificates suitable for use in development (*not* in production.)

### Activate the virtual environment and the identifier environment

    source .venv/bin/activate
    source .env

### Build identifier

    pip install setuptools
    pip install build
    pip install pytest
    python -m build

## Installation

### Install the distribution file

This will install the identifier api in the python virtual environment:

    pip install dist/co.deability.identifier-[version]-py3-none-any.whl

## Running the Identifier API

### Manual startup

    cd src
    ROOT_LOG_LEVEL=INFO APP_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG python -m co.deability.identifier.api.app

### Containerized startup

    docker-compose -p identifier up

[Open your browser](https://localhost:4430/identifier) to verify that it's running, or use `curl`:

    curl https://localhost:4430/identifier

The output should look like this:

    {
        "build_id": "local"
        "status": "OK",
        "timestamp": "Fri, 11 Feb 2022 17:10:13 +0000"
        ...
    }

Note: additional information is included in pre-production environments

## Development

### Testing

    pytest src/tests
